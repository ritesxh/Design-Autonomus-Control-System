# Design-Autonomus-Control-System
The "Autonomous Vehicle Control System: Utilizing Interconnected Vehicles for Enhanced Safety and Ride Experience" seeks to create an autonomous vehicle control system that will allow for the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology. The objectives are to enhance safety and provide a more enjoyable experience for the passengers. These objectives are to be achieved through the development of an interconnected control system that allows for vehicle-to-vehicle communications for additional safety measures and an entertainment-packed ride. System development for autonomous vehicles today focuses on individual vehicle control and fails to consider coordination control. The report aims to be the first step in the automotive industry towards developing control systems for groups of autonomous vehicles. Initial simulations and vehicle tests will be carried out via autonomous ground vehicles developed for research at the University of Arizona. Simulation works will be done on both the ground vehicles and aircraft systems. Initial simulation works will be developed using C programming and later translated to Matlab Simulink
